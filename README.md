# Image Processing Repo
Contains laboratory, test and home works for Image Processing classes of Polevoi Dmitry @ NUST MIS&S 
Details:
- **Laboratory work 1**: Creating binary mask, using thresholds and applying it the the original image
- **Laboratory work 2**: Auto-contrasting using histogram analysis and applying linear-transform via lookup table
- **Laboratory work 3**: 2D-Convolution using OpenCV
- **Test work**: Generating image, finding different gradients of it, calculating module of the gradient and combining them into the new image
- **Homework**: Creating the maps of heights of images and training U-net network to segment the source images using them
  - **Homework pt.1**: Preprocessing dataset - Creating the maps of heights
  - **Homework pt.2**: Training network - Creating U-Net in MxNet Framework and training this model to get segmentation of RGB images from CityScapes
